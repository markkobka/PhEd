### Contest Requirements:

- No third-party UI frameworks are allowed.
- Your app should be compatible with iOS 13 and above.
- The contest features and interfaces must be built from scratch. Using third-party implementations of media editors with similar features is strictly prohibited. Such entries will be disqualified. 

### Evaluation Criteria:

During the evaluation stage, Telegram judges will test the submissions on a broad range of iOS devices from the iPhone 6s to 14 Pro. The key factors in determining the best apps are:

- The **general aesthetics** of the app.
- Adherence to the **provided mockups** and design elements. 
- **Attention to the tiniest details** in the userâ€™s experience.

**The smoothness of animations** and the **overall stability** of the app will play a major role. Last but not least is the absence of significant flaws (including crashes, performance issues, visual glitches, noticeable element blinking, layout imperfections and more).
